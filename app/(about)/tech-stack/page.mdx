# My Tech Stack

I am a software engineer with a passion for web development. I am always on the lookout for new technologies and tools to improve my workflow. I am actively seeking what's new in the industry, so I read a lot of articles, watch videos, and attend conferences to stay up to date.

Here is a list of the tools and technologies I use on a daily basis:

## My Favorite Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): I love Next.js because it allows me to build fast and scalable web applications.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): I am a big fan of TypeScript and typed languages in general. It helps me catch bugs early and makes my code more readable.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): I use Tailwind CSS to style all my applications. CSS can be a pain, so Tailwind CSS is a great tool to speed up the process.
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/): I am not a designer, so having a library of components that I can use in my applications is a great help. shadcn/ui is a great library that I use in all my projects.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/): All my applications are deployed using Vercel. It's a great platform that allows me to deploy my applications in seconds.
- [Bun](https://bun.sh): It's like npm, but way faster.
- [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/): Managing and deploying databases is not the most fun part of development, so having a tool like Convex that allows me to do it in seconds is a great help.
- [Zed](https://zed.dev/): Zed is my primary code editor. I decided to make the switch from VSCode, and I am loving it so far.
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/): I am not a designer, but I use Figma to create wireframes and mockups for my applications. It's a great tool that allows me to quickly create designs.

## Other Tools I Use

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/): It's not my favorite, but since I learned it at school, I am using it to build mobile applications. It does the job.
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/): It's the language used by Flutter. While Flutter is not my favorite, Dart is a great language that I enjoy using. It's fully typed and easy to read.
- [ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet): I used it for some school projects. I like how strict it is, but it's not my go-to technology.
- [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/): The language used by ASP.NET. It's a great language, but I prefer TypeScript.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): I use Docker to containerize my applications. It's a great tool that allows me to run my applications in any environment.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/): I learned it at school and used it for multiple ML projects and others. As I love type safety, Python is a horrible language.
