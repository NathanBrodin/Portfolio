# My Education

I am pursuing a Master's degree in Software Engineering at [ESIEA](https://esiea.fr/en), the 7th best graduate Engineering school in France.

When I was in school, I had no idea of what I wanted to do in life. Not that good in school, but still curious about everything. My mom forced me to attend a graduate school forum, and that were I discovered ESIEA, which was one of the two engineering schools of my small town. I don't come from an educated family, so starting a 5-year engineering program was a big deal for me. I was scared, but I was also excited to learn new things.

I am now in my 4th year, and I don't regret this choice a single bit. I have learned so much, and I am now able to work on projects that I would have never thought possible.

I started without knowing anything about programming, but I got the opportunity to work on a mobile app during my second year, and that where I discovered my passion for coding. Since that, I kept on working on web and mobile projects.
My school is very project-oriented, and I have worked on many projects, from a mobile app to a web platform, and I have learned so much from each of them.
[ESIEA](https://esiea.fr/en) is still a generalist school, so I have learned a bit of everything, from electronics to project management, and I am now able to work on a project from the beginning to the end.

Here's a complete details of all the courses I have taken so far:
