Nathan's AI is a chatbot that has knowledge about my career.
It reads it's context from my [Velite](https://velite.js.org/) content and answers questions about me.
I put a great care about User Experience by polishing all UI details, like list animations, fade on top, etc.

## Tech Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org): For a fast and easy way to use React.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com): Because no one likes writing CSS anymore.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com): For hosting and deployment.
- [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai): For AI capabilities.
- [Velite](https://velite.js.org/): For content management.
