My very first Next.js project, a simple grammar checker that uses the [GPT-3 API](https://openai.com/gpt-3/) to check your text for grammar and spelling mistakes.

Since that, I never left the Next.js ecosystem and I'm still using it for all my projects.

This website is a reproduction of the [Quillbot Grammar Checker](https://quillbot.com/grammar-checker), but with a simpler design and less features.
