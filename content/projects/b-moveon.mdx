B-moveOn is your ultimate companion for cargo bike deliveries, designed to streamline your daily routes and save valuable time. Enter your delivery points and let B-moveOn map out the most efficient path to ensure on-time deliveries and a seamless cycling experience.

This project for parcel delivery began in 2023 in collaboration with ESTACA (Transport Engineering school) and ARIBELL (Spanish factory).

This Flutter application is available on [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.esiea.bmoveon&hl=en&gl=US) for Android and [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/b-moveon/id6471257425) for Iphone, with Gitlab Pipeline for automatic deployment.

The app was developed by a team of 3 students from ESIEA, my French engineering school, as part of a 8-month project. I was in charge of the front-end development and the design of the app.

We went on the newspaper [Ouest France](https://www.ouest-france.fr/pays-de-la-loire/laval-53000/ces-etudiants-ingenieurs-de-laval-developpent-les-applications-du-quotidien-de-demain-7dc431b4-f281-11ee-bc38-55f66082c1a5) and won the second jury prize, but also the second public prize of my school's innovation competition.
