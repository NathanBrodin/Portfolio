An internal web application to manage DNB's chatbots. DNB is the largest financial services group in Norway.
I developed this application during my first internship at DNB. I implemented entierly the frontend of the application using [React](https://reactjs.org), [Redux](https://redux.js.org), and [Styled Component](https://styled-components.com).

My code was shipped to production and impacted thousands of customers.
The team then continued to implement new features, without any problem, showing the quality of the codebase.

For my second internship at DNB, I continued to work on this project, implementing new features due to DNB's chatbot's success.
