SmartDocs is DNB's new internal RAG Chatbot.

Unfortunately, it is not open source or accessible to the public (but believe me, the codebase I wrote is really good).

Learning from my experience, and trying to improve from my previous internship at DNB, I made sure to test the app so that it will be maintanable in the long run.

I noticed from my previous project, Chat Admin Panel, that some developers broke stuff by making changes that they shouldn't have. So for this project, I acheived a 92% code coverage, testing most of the features and capabilities of the app, to make sure breaking changes would not happen again.

I also wrote some extensive documentation, from the README to the code comments, to make sure the app is easy to understand and maintain.
