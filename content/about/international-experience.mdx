During my studies, I had the opportunity to work and study in different countries.

I am French and began my studies in France, but during my teenage years, I traveled to over 20 countries with my family. So, I have always been interested in discovering new cultures and ways of living.

I first did a semester abroad in [Finland](https://net.centria.fi/en/), which sparked my love for Nordic countries. Spending a winter in the snow, with nothing around but trees and lakes, was a unique experience.

Returning to France was hard, so I was looking for a way to go back to the North. I found an internship in [Norway](https://dnb.no) for two months during the summer. I fell in love with the country and its people. I visited every corner of Oslo and took a little weekend trip up north to the mountains. This weekend was a turning point, and I immediately knew that it was in these same landscapes where I wanted to live.

I went back to the same company for a four-month internship, with the objective of delving deeper into the country's culture.

Because I didn't want to return to France and couldn't stay in Norway, I will do another semester abroad in [Sweden](https://www.miun.se/en/). I expect it to be very similar to my experience in Finland, which is why I am excited for it.

My ultimate goal now is to experience Troms√∏, in the north of Norway, and perhaps even live there for a few years. I am actively seeking an internship or job opportunity there, so if you know of any opportunities, please let me know!
