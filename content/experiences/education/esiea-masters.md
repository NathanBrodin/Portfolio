I completed my Master's degree in Software Engineering at [ESIEA](https://esiea.fr), the 7th best graduate Engineering school in France. Graduated with 92/100.

The first few years relied heavily on mathematics, algorithms, physics and electronics, moving toward programming and broader software development and software engineering practices at the end. Coupled with 3 internships for a year of real work experience as I graduated.
