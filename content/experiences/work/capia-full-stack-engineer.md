I'm building an entire web platform from scratch: frontend, backend, infrastructure, all of it.

- Designed the full architecture with long-term scalability in mind
- Set up end-to-end type safety with OpenAPI (drf-spectacular) and Orval-generated TanStack Query hooks
- Built the frontend with React 19 + Compiler, Vite, TanStack Router/Query/Table/Pacer, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, coss ui, and Base UI
- Implemented RBAC, admin tooling, and resource management
- Backend runs on Django REST Framework with Redis caching, ClickHouse integration, and PostgreSQL
- Containerized everything with Docker, deployed via NGINX on self-managed servers
- CI covers linting, builds, schema generation, and automated testing (~700 backend tests, ~100 Playwright E2E) with caching and sharding
- Wrote docs, DX tooling, DB seeding, and Makefile commands so the whole thing sets up in a few commands
