Worked across multiple AI products used by 100k+ users. Last internship, 6 months, counted toward my Master's degree (graded 92/100).

- Built a full E2E test suite with Playwright. 350+ tests across browsers, CI runs in under 90s with caching and sharding
- Refactored the styling architecture to make it more scalable and consistent
- Led theming and dark mode for DNB's public chatbot UI (1.5M+ conversations/year)
- Migrated a production app from Gatsby to Vite, cutting build times by 60%
- Wrote technical docs and analysis reports, generally tried to make the DX better for the team
